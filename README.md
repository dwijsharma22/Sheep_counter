# Sheep_counter
This is a tinkercad simulation of a device which keeps track of the number of sheep inside the land.<br/>
I used arduino uno 3 for this project.<br/>
There are two PIR sensors which are placed together and coded in such a way that they will count the sheeps in the farm at a point.<br/>
The counting depends on the relative motion of the sheep, if the sheep triggers one sensor then the count will be in the positive direction and vice-versa.<br/>
